// If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, 
// then that file will have to be compiled. 
// That means that before the file reaches a web browser,
// a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

// JSX Elements: This JSX element looks exactly like HTML!
const p = <p>Hello world</p>;

// JSX Elements and Their Surroundings
// const is a variable and can be used anywhere
const myArticle = <article>Something</article>

// Attributes in JSX
// JSX elements can have attributes,// just like HTML 
// elements can. my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
const p1 = <p id="large">foo</p>;
const p2 = <p id="small">bar</p>;
